# Simple Pong (Retro!)

This is a simple pong game I wrote to show how easy it is to use PIXI.js with React! It uses onyl some simple shapes and a little javaScript to handle movements!

to get started clone the repository:

```
git clone <URL>
```

then install all the dependacies and packages using yarn:

```
yarn install
```

Now you're all set to run the game and get started!

```
yarn start
```
